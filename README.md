Project Title: Virtual Reality Application for Needle Placement Training

Project Description:
This project focuses on the development and evaluation of virtual reality (VR) applications aimed at improving needle placement accuracy in medical training. The applications were designed to simulate the three layers of human skin and provide haptic feedback to enhance user performance. The project targeted students interested in needle placement, with the ultimate goal of benefiting medical professionals and trainees.

Project Objectives:

Develop two VR applications with different haptic feedback mechanisms per skin layer.

Conduct user studies to evaluate the impact of haptic feedback on needle placement accuracy.

Analyze user performance and success rates in both applications.

Provide insights into the software engineering process and individual contributions to the project.

Project Components:

VR Applications: Two applications were developed to simulate needle placement in the hypodermis layer of human skin. Application 1 provided consistent haptic feedback, while Application 2 offered varying haptic feedback per layer.

User Studies: The project involved instructing participants to complete the needle placement task in both applications and recording their results. Success or failure was indicated by a color change on a cloth next to the hand.

Data Collection: The project collected quantitative data through user studies and Likert scale surveys to analyze user performance and preferences.

Software Engineering Insights: The project employed agile methods and followed the software engineering lifecycle to ensure success in application development.

Contributions:

Priyanka Gautam: Contributed to scripting, coding aesthetic aspects of the project, and project idea implementation.
Anand Patel: Primarily focused on modeling 3D hands within Blender and setting up the overall scene within Unity.
